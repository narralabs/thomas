# Thomas

A Rails application template with the narralabs defaults. These defaults are optimized for deployment using Docker and in AWS ECS Fargate.

## Requirements

In order to use the rails application template, you need to have:

- At least ruby 2.7.4
- At least rails 7.0.2.3

## Usage

Create a new rails using the following:

```
rails new blog -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/narralabs/thomas/main/template.rb
```

It is recommended that you deploy immediately after creating an app using the template.
This will ensure that we do continuous deployment from the beginning of the application.
